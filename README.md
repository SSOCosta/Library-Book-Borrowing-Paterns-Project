# Exploring the Evolution of Book Borrowing Patterns and User Engagement in Netherlands Libraries

# Overview
This project aims to investigate the evolution of book borrowing habits and user engagement in Netherlands libraries over the last 18 years (2005-2022).
The goal is to gain insights into the changes in library dynamics, providing a comprehensive understanding of how user behavior and borrowing preferences have 
transformed during this period.

# Project Goal
The primary goal of this exploration is to uncover and analyze shifts in library dynamics, specifically focusing on:
 - Changes in book borrowing patterns
 - Evolving user engagement trends
 - Scope
The project will cover data analysis and visualization for the years 2005 to 2022, incorporating relevant datasets and metrics to assess the transformation in user 
behavior within Netherlands libraries.

# Presentation
The findings of this exploration will be presented in a comprehensive presentation. The presentation will cover key aspects such as:
